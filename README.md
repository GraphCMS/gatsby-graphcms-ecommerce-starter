## The stack

Why settle for monolithic ecommerce platforms when you can make the most of the best APIs to build what you want. In this example we use a variety of services to perform your typical ecommerce tasks. #DIYCommerce

- **[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)**: Localised product content, reviews, and order management.
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**: Used to securely process payments and Strong Customer Authentication.
- **[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)**: Statically build product pages and handle cart/checkout logic.
- **[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com)**: Deliver order received and dispatched email notifications to customers.
- **[Printful](https://printful.com)**: Create inventory and drop ship with ease.

## How it works

... Describe how the overall architecture works and outputs a functioning ecommerce store.

1. Add to Cart
2. Checkout
3. Pay with Stripe

⚠️ You must have a payment method registered with Printful for orders to be fulfilled automatically. You will be charged for Printful orders once they are created via the API, it's your responsibility to capture payments/manage payouts any funds from the customer via Stripe.

## How to use

If you wish to extend and work with this example locally, follow the instructions below.

If you'd rather check out a [demo](https://gatsby-graphcms-ecommerce-starter.netlify.com) or deploy to your own Netlify, you can do that too.

Add the necessary variables to `.env`.

### 3. (optional): Configure Stripe/Printful webhooks

TODO: ... Configure hooks... Configure ngrok for local testing...
